# Custom Last Post

[phpBB 3.1] (https://www.phpbb.com/) Extension Custom Last Post

## Description

Customize which text the *Last Post* link on the board index displays. This is useful if the subject of the last post is empty, because in this case phpBB by default displays no link.

The extension can be configured in the Admin Control Panel:
* The *Last Post* link displays the subject of the last post (default, this conforms to the phpBB default),
* it displays the title of the topic containing the last post, or
* it displays the post subject if it is not empty and the topic title otherwise.
